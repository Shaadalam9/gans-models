In the realm of road safety and vehicles, conducting experiments, especially in critical and accident-prone scenarios, proves challenging. Researchers worldwide leverage various software and virtual environments to capture readings, often relying on synthetic instances inspired by daily life. These simulations draw from images, videos on the internet, or the researchers' imaginative capabilities. However, the simulated environments often lack the tactile realism of the actual world. In the current era saturated with internet images and videos, collecting crucial scenarios in vehicle and road user interactions remains an ongoing hurdle. Despite the lack of the data on a critical case, studies frequently resort to artificially generated scenarios (developed by humans), inadvertently neglecting pivotal real-world environment. To address these limitations, our project delves into the groundbreaking application of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs offer a transformative solution by synthesizing realistic samples that cover a broader spectrum of road user interactions. By training GANs on diverse datasets representing various geographical locations and cultural contexts, we enrich the representativeness of our data, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of critical scenarios in autonomous vehicle environments. Moreover, the adaptability of GANs to evolving environments, ethical considerations (generate fake ids), and seamless integration with sensor data highlight their potential to significantly contribute to enhancing road safety through generative AI-driven predictive modeling for autonomous vehicles. This project not only pioneers the use of GANs for creating realistic datasets but also emphasizes their adaptability to dynamic road environments and potential for generalization across diverse locations. The integration of synthetic data with real sensor data further enriches the training process. Ethical considerations are paramount, ensuring that the generated scenarios are representative and unbiased, contributing to the overall safety and fairness of autonomous vehicle systems. Collaborative industry efforts, potential for scenario-specific training, and rigorous validation protocols align with broader advancements in autonomous vehicle technology. This innovative approach holds promise for creating a more resilient and responsive autonomous driving system, poised to navigate the intricacies of real-world scenarios and significantly enhance road safety.
